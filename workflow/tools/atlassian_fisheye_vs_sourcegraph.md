## [Atlassian FishEye](https://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye)

Atlassian released FishEye around 2007, initially as a source browser for companies who (before the advent of GitHub/Bitbucket) mostly lacked web-based source code browsers. You can try it out on [JBoss’ public FishEye instance](https://source.jboss.org/browse) (see [example quick search results page](https://source.jboss.org/qsearch?q=open&t=3&s=2&bucket=ANY_DATE&userFilter=) and [example advanced search results page](https://source.jboss.org/search/Aesh/?head=true&comment=&contents=open&addedText=&deletedText=&filename=&branch=&tag=&fromdate=&todate=&datesortorder=DESCENDING&groupby=file&col=path&col=revision&col=author&col=date&col=csid&refresh=y)).

**What people tell us they love about FishEye:**

* It integrates well with the Atlassian suite of products
* It integrates well with builds in particular (when using Atlassian Bamboo)
* It supports Perforce (as well as Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and CVS)
* Stability and reliability

**What has made organizations switch from FishEye:**

* “It feels like FishEye’s code search is for managers to report on changes, not for developers in their daily workflow”
* Poor integration with GitHub and GitLab
* It is deprioritized by Atlassian, with [only infrequent and minor feature releases](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/fisheye-releases-960155725.html)
