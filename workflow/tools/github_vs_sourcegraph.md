* **[GitHub code search](https://help.github.com/en/articles/searching-code)**, **[GitLab code search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_global_search.html)**, **[Bitbucket Server code search](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/search-for-code-in-bitbucket-server-814204781.html)**, **[Bitbucket Cloud code search](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/search-873876782.html)**: These are great solutions for smaller teams who already use these code hosts and who have simple/infrequent code search needs. The main pain points we hear are that they lack support for punctuation or regexps in queries, and the UXs are not optimized for searching across multiple repositories.
