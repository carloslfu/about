## [Hound](https://github.com/etsy/hound)

Hound was created inside Etsy by [Kelly Norton](https://github.com/kellegous) and others and open-sourced in 2015. It appears to not be actively maintained anymore, with the most recent commit (as of this document's publishing) being more than 5 months old, and many open PRs unattended to.

**What people tell us they love about Hound:**

* Very simple deployment
* Very simple interface

**What has made organizations switch from Hound:**

* Apparent unmaintained status
* Poor scalability to many repositories (both performance-wise and UX-wise)
* Limited filtering available for search queries
* No support for code navigation (code intelligence and/or ctags)
