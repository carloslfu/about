## [Livegrep](https://github.com/livegrep/livegrep)

Livegrep is maintained by a Stripe developer and is used inside Stripe. It has a slick demo on the Linux source code at livegrep.com.

**What people tell us they love about Livegrep:**

* Instant, as-you-type search results
* Quick search filters to narrow by path, etc.

**What has made organizations plan to switch from Livegrep:**

* No support for code navigation (code intelligence and/or ctags)
* Difficult to manage and scale (requires building custom infrastructure)
* Although it’s used heavily by a small number of companies, it’s maintained part-time by a single developer, so future trajectory is limited
