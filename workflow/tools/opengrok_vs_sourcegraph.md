## [Oracle OpenGrok](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok)

OpenGrok was traditionally the most popular open-source code search tool. Originally developed inside Sun Microsystems around 2004, itâ€™s now an Oracle open-source project after Oracle acquired Sun.

**What people tell us they love about OpenGrok:**

* Simple interface
* Support for non-Git repositories
* Easy deployment (for Java shops)

**What has made organizations switch from OpenGrok:**

* Slow and difficult-to-manage indexing process (leading to stale results for users)
* Poor support for searching/browsing multiple commits and branches
* Poor scalability to many repositories and for large repositories
* Inflexible and buggy API (using the new REST API)
